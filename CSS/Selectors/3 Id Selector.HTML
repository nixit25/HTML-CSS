    <p>
        <li>
            A website title identifies what the web page is about for both web users and search engines. On web
            browsers, the website title appears at the top of the tab or window, and in search results website titles
            display as bold hyperlinked texts.
        </li>
    </p>


    <p>
        Website title creation can feel like an art, but by following the below steps and avoiding common mistakes you
        can be assured your title is as best presented as possible.
    </p>


    <h2><span id="sub">1. Prevent Title Truncation</span> </h2>

    <p>
        Title truncation happens when a website title is too long to fit into a search engine’s standard pixel width.
        Title truncation is often displayed as the end of the website title being cut off and instead replaced with an
        ellipsis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Avoid this practice by opting to keep your title within 50-60 characters. Title truncation can dissuade visitors
        by how unfinished and uninformative it looks. Additionally, it can damage search engine rankings if the entire
        title cannot be crawled. Keep your title concise but precise to give your visitors the information they need.
    </p>


    <h2><span id="sub">2. Avoid Using All Caps</span> </h2>

    <p>
        Website titles written in all caps are generally viewed upon as bad form and come across as unprofessional and
        often spammy. Whilst you may be enthusiastic to communicate your website information, nobody wants it shouted at
        them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The only exception to this rule is if your brand name is written in all caps, and even then it should be placed
        at the end of the website title. Otherwise to format your title tag correctly, capitalize either by sentence
        case where only the first letter of the first word is capitalized or by title case where the first letter of
        most words is capitalized
    </p>

    <h2> <span id="sub">3. Don’t Keyword Stuff</span></h2>

    <p>
        Website titles should be optimized for one selected keyword and the chosen phrase should appear in the title in
        a natural manner. Keyword stuffing is the opposite of this and happens when other irrelevant keywords are placed
        throughout the title to try and manipulate page rank.
    </p>

    <h2><span id="sub">4. Give Every Page a Unique Title</span></h2>

    <p>
        Each page on a website should be unique, so page titles should be too. Ensure that each page's title tags are
        optimized so that they reflect the content found on their specific page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Displaying clear information will allow search engines and users to understand what information your content
        contains and what that specific page is about.
    </p>

    <h2><span id="sub">5. Don’t Duplicate Titles. </span></h2>

    <p>
        Duplicate web pages harm search engine rankings through robots failing to differentiate the differences between
        the pages, and therefore considering (and ranking) them as the same page.
    </p>

    <p>
        eCommerce website owners are mostly at risk of duplicate web page titles, especially if they’re selling products
        similar in shape, size, or identity. To identify duplicate title risks lookout for two or more pages with
        similar content and page titles whose only differences are their URLs, or two or more pages with similar page
        titles but that possess different content on the pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prevent duplicate titles by creating website titles that accurately reflect the page content, even if
        differences between pages are only minor. Get creative with which angle to present the information at, or fixate
        on one particular aspect of one page’s content over another.
